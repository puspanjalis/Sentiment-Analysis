Emotions are a key aspect of social interactions, influencing the way people behave and shaping relationships. This is especially true with language — with only a few words, we're able to express a wide variety of subtle and complex emotions. As such, it’s been a long-term goal among the research community to enable machines to understand context and emotion, which would, in turn, enable a variety of applications, including empathetic chatbots, models to detect harmful online behavior, and improved customer support interactions.

## Project Brief: 
This experiment aims to classify emotions based on their polarity using the collection of documents and its emotions, It helps greatly in NLP Classification tasks

## Dataset :
The data set is taken from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion). This dataset contains list of documents with emotion flag, Dataset is split into train, test & validation for building the machine learning model

## Inspiration
Dataset helps the community to develop emotion classification models with NLP based approach.

Few questions your emotion classification model can answer based on your customer review

- What is the sentiment of your customer comment?
- What is the mood of today's special food ?

**Example :-**
_i feel like I am still looking at a blank canvas blank pieces of paper;sadness_
